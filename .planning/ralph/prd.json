  "name": "Stone v1.0",
  "description": "Stone's roadmap follows a dependency-driven path from foundation to polish. Phase 1 establishes the app architecture and core time tracking with accurate timer behavior across sleep/wake cycles. Phase 2 builds project organization features (folders, tags, colors) on the stable foundation. Phase 3 adds reporting and visualization once time data exists. Phase 4 integrates CloudKit sync after the data model is proven stable. Phase 5 adds final polish and convenience features.",
