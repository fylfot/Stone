## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Screenshot/activity monitoring | Surveillance anti-pattern, breaks trust |
| Built-in invoicing | Use existing tools, export CSV instead |
| Team/multi-user features | Solo freelancer focus |
| iOS/watchOS apps | macOS only for v1 |
| Automatic time tracking | Manual control preferred, no surveillance |
| Third-party integrations | Native-only approach |
| Pomodoro timer | Different use case, separate app |
| Calendar integration | High complexity, defer to v2+ |
